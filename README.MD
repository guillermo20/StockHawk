## StockHawk: 3rd project of the Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

* Starting to analise the initial state of the app against the UX review provided from udacity
    ** the first issue is for visually impaired users, must fix.
    ** second, mark the necessary strings on the values resource file for translation
    ** display a detail activity so the users can see the value over time of a selected stock
       this might require the use of new library to draw graphs.

    ** use a widget to monitor the stocks
    ** fix the app crashes when user search for an unexistant stock issue.
    ** add some notification that reflects the state of the server to the user.
